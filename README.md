# Vert Ramp Affirmation
Software pipeline overview for Display Lab's Tailored Performance Feedback System.
![overview](doc/overview.svg)

This project serves as the overview of the parts of the feedback production pipeline.
It contains stubs and mock ups to illustrate components of the intervention pipeline.
Specifically, it has examples to demonstrate tailoring feedback for two recipients.

## Background
The Display Lab work is divided into two parts: User Centered Design and Feedback Production.
User Centered Design produces:
- Display Templates
- Performance Data Annotations
- Causal Pathways (Formerly Intervention Situation Relations)
- Ascribee Descriptions

Feedback Production consumes the above and produces:
- Appropriate Performance Feedback Displays

## Outline
The major steps of the intervention generation pipeline:
1. Data analsis for performance features
1. Performance feedback candidate generation
1. Reasoning about appropriateness of candidates 
1. Scoring and promotion of candidates for figure generation
1. Generate performance summary figures using promoted candidates

## Definitions
- Display Template: Code to generate plot or figure.
- Ascribee: A person to which performance values are ascribed. 
- Annotations: Mathematical calculations to make assertions from performance data.
- Candidate: A mashup of the attributes of a template and an ascribee.  Created as a computational convenience.
- Causal Pathway: Computable representation of theory or domain expertise about what makes a performance display candidate appropriate.
- Spek: top level data container for metadata: templates, causal pathways, ascribees, and candidates.
