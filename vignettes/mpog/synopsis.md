## Performance data
Anonymized performance data for a single measure for 207 performers.
Trimmed last 6 months of 2017.

## Comparator
Static 90% goal benchmark.
Peer comparison goal will be calculated. 

## Recipient annotations
The annotations function supplied with this vignette operates on numerator and denominator data.
Each annotation calcultates the rate for the measure being examined.

## Template annotations
The worse_social_bar template is about a negative performance gap set and a social comparator element:
1. Social comparator element (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/psdo_0000045)
2. Negative performance gap set (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/psdo_0000116)

## Resulting candidates
The expected number of candidates is recipients (207) \* templates (8) = candidates (1656)
